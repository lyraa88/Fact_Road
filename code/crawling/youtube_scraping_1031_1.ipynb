Meanwhile, a train resembling one long used by North Korean rulers was parked last week near a coastal leadership compound in Wonsan, according to an analysis of satellite imagery released Sunday by the website 38 North. A prominent South Korea adviser also rejected the notion that Kim was ailing or dead.\\n\\n“Our government position is firm,” Moon Chung-in, a foreign policy adviser to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, told CNN. “He has been staying in the Wonsan area since April 13” with “no suspicious movements” detected. South Korea’s Unification Ministry on Monday reiterated a government assessment made last week that there has been no unusual movement spotted inside North Korea.\\n\\nThe latest developments shed little immediate light about the 36-year-old ruler, who U.S. officials said they were told had been in critical condition after cardiovascular surgery. Kim -- a heavy smoker who has gained considerable weight since taking power in 2011 -- hasn’t appeared in state media for two weeks, and missed the April 15 birthday celebrations for his late grandfather, state founder Kim Il Sung, for the first time.\\n\\nState media Rodong Sinmun newspaper’s front page on Monday carried a story of Kim Jong Un expressing “gratitude” toward his construction workers in Wonsan-Kalma, a tourist beach resort zone that the leader has made one of his signature projects. It’s not unusual for state media to report on activities associated with the leader during an absence from the public.\\n\\nThe episode renews longstanding questions about the stability of a regime built on iron-fisted authority and a cult of personality for Kim, who has no known successor. Health scares have been a common occurrence over the years, and the leader’s medical condition is a closely guarded subject in one of the world’s most secretive states.\\n\\nAny leadership change in North Korea could increase the threat of instability on China’s border and raise questions about control of the country’s expanding nuclear arsenal. Kim has also been central to U.S. President Donald Trump’s so far unsuccessful efforts to get him to reduce his weapons stockpile.\\n\\nThe mystery sent journalists, diplomats and non-proliferation experts scouring satellite images, state news outlets and unverified social media feeds for clues about Kim. The hashtag #kimjongundead was the among the top subjects trending globally Saturday on Twitter. The name of his younger sister Kim Yo Jong -- a potential successor -- was also trending in the U.S.\\n\\nKim similarly disappeared from state media for six weeks in 2014, prompting speculation that he had been sidelined by gout, an ankle injury or was even overthrown in a coup. He subsequently showed up walking with a cane during a visit to a new residential block.\\n\\nThe presence of Kim’s train in Wonsan, about 230 kilometers (140 miles) east of Pyongyang and the site of a palatial family compound, potentially fits with the South Korean account. Under Kim, Wonsan has seen a building boom for tourism facilities and lodgings for the state’s elite. The area has been a hotbed for missile tests, which are easy for Kim to view when he’s at the family compound.\\n\\nThe train, which Kim took to his failed summit with Trump in Hanoi, arrived at a nearby railway station on or before April 21, 38 North wrote, citing satellite imagery. The train was spotted again at the station on April 23, and appeared to be repositioned for departure.\\n\\nNorth Korea’s eastern coast saw a burst of military activity on April 14, including cruise missile tests and fighter jet maneuvers, that at the time appeared to be timed to coincide with South Korean parliamentary elections. The next day, Kim was absent from events marking his grandfather’s birthday, known as the Day of the Sun and North Korea’s most politically significant holiday.\\n\\n\\nRead more: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articl...\\n\\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8Gm\\n\\nQUICKTAKE ON SOCIAL:\\nFollow QuickTake on Twitter: twitter.com/quicktake\\nLike QuickTake on Facebook: facebook.com/quicktake\\nFollow QuickTake on Instagram: instagram.com/quicktake\\nSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZ\\nEmail us at quicktakenews@gmail.com\\n\\nQuickTake by Bloomberg is a global news network delivering up-to-the-minute analysis on the biggest news, trends and ideas for a new generation of leaders.', '302']\n",

The health of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is in serious question Tuesday morning (April 14, 2020) after he failed to appear at a major public celebration. Unconfirmed reports say Kim had heart surgery and maybe fighting for his life. The last time he was seen in public was April 11, meeting with top advisers. Ramy Inocencio says the world doesn't know yet if the leader is alive, sick or even dead but today, As per KetK TV, an NBC affiliated television station that was serving Tyler and Longview, Texas, United States. According to them, it was reported that the Supreme Leader of North Korea has died today at the age of 36 due to heart surgery failure. Kim Yo-jong (Korean: 김여정, born 26 September 1988)[1][2] is a North Korean politician. She is the youngest daughter of former supreme leader Kim Jong-il. Her brother is Kim Jong-un, the current supreme leader. She is an alternate member of the Politburo (Political Bureau) and vice director of the Propaganda and Agitation Department of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK)\\nThe 36-year-old has worked tirelessly in the nine years since his father Kim Jong-il’s death to concentrate power in his own grasp, purging would-be rivals and even close family members deemed a threat to his dominion.Simply put, said Leif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul: “The North Korean system could not continue in its current ideological and institutional form without an adult male descendant of Kim Il-sung.”\\n\\n#KimJongUnDied #NorthKorea #KimYoJong #SupremeLeaderDeath #RealOrFake\", '23']\n",

One of the officials said the White House was told that Kim took a turn for the worse after the procedure, while CNN earlier cited a U.S. official with direct knowledge saying the 36-year-old leader may be in “grave danger.” The White House declined to comment.\\n\\nMeanwhile, South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s office said that Kim was conducting “normal activities” in a rural part of the country assisted by close aides and no special movements were detected. Moon spokesman Kang Min-seok said earlier there was nothing to confirm on the speculation over Kim’s health.\\n\\nThe news around Kim’s health spurred the benchmark Kospi gauge to extend losses to as much as 3% while the won slid as much as 1.7% against the dollar. The Kospi closed 1% lower.\\n\\nThe health of Kim, overweight and a heavy smoker, is one of North Korea’s most closely guarded secrets, typically only known by a handful of people in the inner circle of leadership. While North Korea had scaled down major events as it battles the coronavirus pandemic, speculation about Kim had been growing since his unprecedented absence from April 15 celebrations for the birthday of his grandfather and state founder Kim Il Sung, one of the biggest days on the country’s calendar.\\n\\nEven the most well-informed North Korea experts find it hard to tell what’s happening in the secretive state. The Daily NK, a Seoul-based website that gathers information from informants inside the isolated nation, separately reported that Kim underwent a “cardiovascular surgical procedure” and was now mostly recovered. Reuters cited an official with the Chinese Communist Party’s International Liaison Department saying that Kim wasn’t believed to be critically ill.\\n\\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8Gm\\n\\nQUICKTAKE ON SOCIAL:\\nFollow QuickTake on Twitter: twitter.com/quicktake\\nLike QuickTake on Facebook: facebook.com/quicktake\\nFollow QuickTake on Instagram: instagram.com/quicktake\\nSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZ\\nEmail us at quicktakenews@gmail.com\\n\\nQuickTake by Bloomberg is a global news network delivering up-to-the-minute analysis on the biggest news, trends and ideas for a new generation of leaders.', '471']\n",

One of the officials said the White House was told that Kim took a turn for the worse after the procedure, while CNN earlier cited a U.S. official with direct knowledge saying the 36-year-old leader may be in “grave danger.” The White House declined to comment.\\n\\nMeanwhile, South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s office said that Kim was conducting “normal activities” in a rural part of the country assisted by close aides and no special movements were detected. Moon spokesman Kang Min-seok said earlier there was nothing to confirm on the speculation over Kim’s health.\\n\\nThe news around Kim’s health spurred the benchmark Kospi gauge to extend losses to as much as 3% while the won slid as much as 1.7% against the dollar. The Kospi closed 1% lower.\\n\\nThe health of Kim, overweight and a heavy smoker, is one of North Korea’s most closely guarded secrets, typically only known by a handful of people in the inner circle of leadership. While North Korea had scaled down major events as it battles the coronavirus pandemic, speculation about Kim had been growing since his unprecedented absence from April 15 celebrations for the birthday of his grandfather and state founder Kim Il Sung, one of the biggest days on the country’s calendar.\\n\\nEven the most well-informed North Korea experts find it hard to tell what’s happening in the secretive state. The Daily NK, a Seoul-based website that gathers information from informants inside the isolated nation, separately reported that Kim underwent a “cardiovascular surgical procedure” and was now mostly recovered. Reuters cited an official with the Chinese Communist Party’s International Liaison Department saying that Kim wasn’t believed to be critically ill.\\n\\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8Gm\\n\\nQUICKTAKE ON SOCIAL:\\nFollow QuickTake on Twitter: twitter.com/quicktake\\nLike QuickTake on Facebook: facebook.com/quicktake\\nFollow QuickTake on Instagram: instagram.com/quicktake\\nSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZ\\nEmail us at quicktakenews@gmail.com\\n\\nQuickTake by Bloomberg is a global news network delivering up-to-the-minute analysis on the biggest news, trends and ideas for a new generation of leaders.', '471']\n",

But South Korea’s National Security Council said last Thursday they had not observed unusual movement in North Korea, and Unification Ministry spokeswoman Cho Hyesil reiterated that assessment in a press briefing on Monday.\\n\\nQuestions seem certain to continue circulating until the North Korean leader -- a heavy smoker who has gained considerable weight since taking power in 2011 -- appears again.

He subsequently showed up walking with a cane during a visit to a new residential block.\\n\\n“Nobody knows where he is,” Trump said Monday.\\n\\nThe episode renews longstanding questions about the stability of a regime built on iron-fisted authority and the cult of personality surrounding Kim, who has no known successor. Health scares have been a common occurrence over the years, and the leader’s medical condition is a closely guarded subject in one of the world’s most secretive states.\\n\\nThe hashtag #kimjongundead was the among the top subjects trending globally Saturday on Twitter. The name of his younger sister Kim Yo Jong -- a potential successor -- was also trending in the U.S.\\n\\nAny leadership change in North Korea could increase the threat of instability on China’s border and raise questions about control of the country’s expanding nuclear arsenal. Kim has also been central to Trump’s so far unsuccessful efforts to get him to reduce his weapons stockpile.\\n\\n“I’ve had a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un,” Trump said Monday.\\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8Gm\\n\\nQUICKTAKE ON SOCIAL:\\nFollow QuickTake on Twitter: twitter.com/quicktake\\nLike QuickTake on Facebook: facebook.com/quicktake\\nFollow QuickTake on Instagram: instagram.com/quicktake\\nSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZ\\nEmail us at quicktakenews@gmail.com\\n\\nQuickTake by Bloomberg is a global news network delivering up-to-the-minute analysis on the biggest news, trends and ideas for a new generation of leaders.', '511']\n",

Is it at a tipping point?\\n\\nI'm not sure it's tipping point for Brazil, but it's a tipping point for Bolsonaro. When he came in, it was after years of political scandal, Lava Jato. You had impeachments, ministers getting thrown out of office. Former President Lula in jail. Dilma Rousseff impeached. Finally, somebody clean who has the former federal justice who helped put away a lot of these ministers as the new minister of justice.\\n\\nNow, a president that mishandled coronavirus, attacked the governors as fake news, you can't have shut downs, and cases in Brazil are spiraling much higher per capita than in other major Latin American economies; now he's gotten rid of his minister of justice. He's resigned, said Bolsonaro is interfering with investigations, getting too close to his family. That is the opposite of what you want in the midst of the worst economic contraction, maybe in Brazil's democratic history. His approval ratings are dropping, down in the low 30s. He might end up getting impeached. He'd have to lose more support. But, the idea that he governs effectively in Congress with a reformist coalition is off the table. He is in a lot of trouble. This is the beginning of what I suspect will eventually be the end of Bolsonaro. It's much harder to imagine him getting another term. Even lasting the full term.\\n\\nWhy is speculation surrounding Kim Jong-un difficult to confirm or debunk?\\n\\nIt's the world's most closed totalitarian dictatorship. We haven't heard from Kim or anyone representing Kim saying how Kim is doing for a couple of weeks. Yesterday, President Trump said we're going to hear from him soon, which is the closest we've had to intelligence, believe it or not. It sounds like Trump has heard through US intelligence that Kim Jong-un is still alive. Probably vis the Chinese. Not from the North Koreans.\\n\\nWe still haven't heard from him and that does imply, especially given rumors and a big national holiday just a few days ago, that he's not well, not able to appear publicly for mass consumption. Does that mean he's a vegetable? No, but it does mean he's hurting, there's a real problem. If he does die, if there needs to be a transition, it's dangerous. The potential that the Chinese might have to step in is real. They would if it looked like instability could shake the regime or lead to a dispute over control of nuclear weapons and conventional forces in North Korea. Until we find out Kim Jong-un is okay, there's a lot of concern.\\n\\nFinally, has Africa been spared by coronavirus?\\n\\nNumbers of cases in Africa are very low. The main reason is because they're not testing. Helps that there isn't as much travel to/from Africa, which is part of why it's economically underdeveloped, but also limits cases into African countries. Chinese from Wuhan went to Africa, working there. They were in China during the New Year's celebrations and left. That's different from spread from travel that you get in the US or Europe.\\n\\nAlso, many cases are asymptomatic. We're finding that in New York, in Massachusetts, in Washington State, in California. These are very young populations in Africa. The most populous country in Africa, Nigeria, 18 years, I think, is the average age. The vast majority of people that get this disease won't have symptoms, never mind getting sick. If you're an African leader and don't have ventilators, adequate health care personnel, test kits - and your economy's in bad shape, you keep economies open. That doesn't mean that Africa is spared because we have economic slowdown globally, and people aren't going to be traveling there, you won't get tourism, supply chains will get disrupted, but you probably don't get the kind of closures of African economies as in other countries, even emerging market economies. Even where they do, so much of the economy is informal, not controlled by the government, so it doesn't shut down. You'll see a lot of people getting sick, people dying. Whether or not that's known publicly, or it's considered dying from some other comorbidity, is an open question. But some of the poorest countries in the world probably won't have the same impact from coronavirus. If there are silver linings, we'll take them.\\n\\nSubscribe to GZERO on YouTube: http://bit.ly/2TxCVnY\\n\\nFor more GZERO news and videos: https://www.gzeromedia.com/\\nSubscribe to the GZERO podcast: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast...\\nLike GZERO on Facebook:   / gzeromedia  \\nFollow GZERO on Twitter:   / gzeromedia  \\nFollow GZERO on LinkedIn:   / 18385722  \\n\\nGZERO Media is a multimedia publisher providing news, insights and commentary on the events shaping our world.

Let\\'s take a look\\n[Pkg]\\nThe South Korean government believes reports of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un being critically ill lacks credibility. According to the nation\\'s top office, there is nothing it can confirm about Kim\\'s reported health, and no unusual signs were detected from inside the regime. This likely means, based on analysis of data obtained through Seoul-Washington intel assets, there is nothing unusual about Kim\\'s activities or any other particular signs within the communist state such as the movement of medical staff. Some even speculate Kim is going about daily routines as usual. A senior Cheong Wa Dae official said Kim is believed to be currently staying with his entourage in a provincial region, engaging in various activities. The official added there are no noteworthy moves from the ruling Workers Party, Cabinet or the military. Kim has not been publicly seen since April 11, when he presided over a Workers Party politburo meeting. Seoul\\'s Foreign Ministry has been communicating with the U.S. State Department since the report on Kim\\'s health emerged but there appears to be no unusual signs. \\n[Soundbite] KIM IN-CHUL(FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN) : \"What we can say is that S.

North Korea, which has quarantined tens of thousands as precautionary steps, officially sealed its border with China in January, but smuggling across the frontier likely still happens. \\nActivist groups in Seoul said they\\'ve been told by contacts in North Korea that people had died of the virus. Those claims cannot be independently verified.\\nNorth Korea\\'s socialist free medical service collapsed in the mid-1990s amid economic chaos and a famine. In recent years, Kim Jong Un has built new hospitals and modernized some medical facilities as the economy improved, but most of the medical benefits still largely go to his ruling elite, experts say.\\nChoi said his monthly salary was the equivalent of about 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of rice and that he received cigarettes from patients in return for telling them what medicine they should buy at markets. \\nDuring the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, Choi said hundreds of people in Chongjin died after suffering flu-like symptoms during eight months of intense quarantine.\\n\"But none (doctors) can dare to diagnose the dead with SARS. There wasn\\'t an order to confirm the cause of their deaths, and we didn\\'t have diagnostic kits,\" said Choi, now a researcher at a Korea University institute.  \\nDuring a 2009 flu outbreak, Choi said he didn\\'t have diagnostic kits and asked patients with fevers what antibiotics they had used before placing some under quarantine. After many patients died, he speculated their deaths were likely linked to the flu.  \\nIn a highly unusual admission of a disease outbreak apparently aimed at winning outside aid, North Korea\\'s state media said in December 2009 that nine people in Pyongyang and the northwestern border town of Sinuiju had died of the flu.  \\nSome say North Korea may not have big clusters of infections because it doesn\\'t have densely populated cities and strictly restricts freedom of movement and association. But many others disagree, saying all North Koreans are required to attend diverse state-organized group activities and a lack of adequate sanitation could worsen outbreaks. \\nChoi said many cannot afford to quarantine themselves for long because they have to work.\\n\\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \\nTwitter:   / ap_archive   \\nFacebook:   / aparchives   \\nInstagram:   / apnews  \\n\\n\\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/you...', '4']\n",

Meanwhile, a train resembling one long used by North Korean rulers was parked last week near a coastal leadership compound in Wonsan, according to an analysis of satellite imagery released Sunday by the website 38 North. A prominent South Korea adviser also rejected the notion that Kim was ailing or dead.\\n\\n“Our government position is firm,” Moon Chung-in, a foreign policy adviser to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, told CNN. “He has been staying in the Wonsan area since April 13” with “no suspicious movements” detected. South Korea’s Unification Ministry on Monday reiterated a government assessment made last week that there has been no unusual movement spotted inside North Korea.\\n\\nThe latest developments shed little immediate light about the 36-year-old ruler, who U.S. officials said they were told had been in critical condition after cardiovascular surgery. Kim -- a heavy smoker who has gained considerable weight since taking power in 2011 -- hasn’t appeared in state media for two weeks, and missed the April 15 birthday celebrations for his late grandfather, state founder Kim Il Sung, for the first time.\\n\\nState media Rodong Sinmun newspaper’s front page on Monday carried a story of Kim Jong Un expressing “gratitude” toward his construction workers in Wonsan-Kalma, a tourist beach resort zone that the leader has made one of his signature projects. It’s not unusual for state media to report on activities associated with the leader during an absence from the public.\\n\\nThe episode renews longstanding questions about the stability of a regime built on iron-fisted authority and a cult of personality for Kim, who has no known successor. Health scares have been a common occurrence over the years, and the leader’s medical condition is a closely guarded subject in one of the world’s most secretive states.\\n\\nAny leadership change in North Korea could increase the threat of instability on China’s border and raise questions about control of the country’s expanding nuclear arsenal. Kim has also been central to U.S. President Donald Trump’s so far unsuccessful efforts to get him to reduce his weapons stockpile.\\n\\nThe mystery sent journalists, diplomats and non-proliferation experts scouring satellite images, state news outlets and unverified social media feeds for clues about Kim. The hashtag #kimjongundead was the among the top subjects trending globally Saturday on Twitter. The name of his younger sister Kim Yo Jong -- a potential successor -- was also trending in the U.S.\\n\\nKim similarly disappeared from state media for six weeks in 2014, prompting speculation that he had been sidelined by gout, an ankle injury or was even overthrown in a coup. He subsequently showed up walking with a cane during a visit to a new residential block.\\n\\nThe presence of Kim’s train in Wonsan, about 230 kilometers (140 miles) east of Pyongyang and the site of a palatial family compound, potentially fits with the South Korean account. Under Kim, Wonsan has seen a building boom for tourism facilities and lodgings for the state’s elite. The area has been a hotbed for missile tests, which are easy for Kim to view when he’s at the family compound.\\n\\nThe train, which Kim took to his failed summit with Trump in Hanoi, arrived at a nearby railway station on or before April 21, 38 North wrote, citing satellite imagery. The train was spotted again at the station on April 23, and appeared to be repositioned for departure.\\n\\nNorth Korea’s eastern coast saw a burst of military activity on April 14, including cruise missile tests and fighter jet maneuvers, that at the time appeared to be timed to coincide with South Korean parliamentary elections. The next day, Kim was absent from events marking his grandfather’s birthday, known as the Day of the Sun and North Korea’s most politically significant holiday.\\n\\n\\nRead more: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articl...\\n\\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8Gm\\n\\nQUICKTAKE ON SOCIAL:\\nFollow QuickTake on Twitter: twitter.com/quicktake\\nLike QuickTake on Facebook: facebook.com/quicktake\\nFollow QuickTake on Instagram: instagram.com/quicktake\\nSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZ\\nEmail us at quicktakenews@gmail.com\\n\\nQuickTake by Bloomberg is a global news network delivering up-to-the-minute analysis on the biggest news, trends and ideas for a new generation of leaders.', '302']\n",

(In terms of flattening the curve, and the impact on the North\\'s already fragile ability to take care of the health of its citizens as well as its economy)\\nDr. Barry: It seems President Trump has reached out to North Korea in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Instead, sad music played, and excerpts of the leader’s biography were read before the news broke: North Korea’s leader, Kim Il Sung, had been shot dead. It was Nov. 16, 1986.\\n\\nAccording to the North Korea-focused news site NK News, the message was followed by the lowering of the North Korean flag near the DMZ.

If he was critically ill or died, who would take over the regime?\\nFor weeks now, the world has been grappling with the coronavirus.\\nNorth Korea has reported zero cases. But we\\'ve been hearing reports that the regime has requested and received aid from the International Red Cross, UNICEF and Doctors Without Borders, and it seems they\\'ve had some containment measures in place as some children were reportedly going back to school.\\nJeongmin, what are you hearing about the situation there how is this affecting the daily life of North Korean citizens?\\nDr. Barry: If North Korea is concealing the true numbers, how do you explain the regime\\'s motivaton behind doing that?\\nJeongmin: Handling the coronavirus was one of the major talking points of the ruling party\\'s politburo meeting. How serious do you think the situation is right now and how have authorities been dealing with it?\\nDr. Barry & Jeongmin: What unique challenges does North Korea face regarding the pandemic? (In terms of flattening the curve, and the impact on the North\\'s already fragile ability to take care of the health of its citizens as well as its economy)\\nDr. Barry: It seems President Trump has reached out to North Korea in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. But his claim of receiving a \"nice letter\" from KJU was sharply denied by the North Korean regime.

North Korea, which has quarantined tens of thousands as precautionary steps, officially sealed its border with China in January, but smuggling across the frontier likely still happens. \\nActivist groups in Seoul said they\\'ve been told by contacts in North Korea that people had died of the virus. Those claims cannot be independently verified.\\nNorth Korea\\'s socialist free medical service collapsed in the mid-1990s amid economic chaos and a famine. In recent years, Kim Jong Un has built new hospitals and modernized some medical facilities as the economy improved, but most of the medical benefits still largely go to his ruling elite, experts say.\\nChoi said his monthly salary was the equivalent of about 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of rice and that he received cigarettes from patients in return for telling them what medicine they should buy at markets. \\nDuring the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, Choi said hundreds of people in Chongjin died after suffering flu-like symptoms during eight months of intense quarantine.\\n\"But none (doctors) can dare to diagnose the dead with SARS. There wasn\\'t an order to confirm the cause of their deaths, and we didn\\'t have diagnostic kits,\" said Choi, now a researcher at a Korea University institute.  \\nDuring a 2009 flu outbreak, Choi said he didn\\'t have diagnostic kits and asked patients with fevers what antibiotics they had used before placing some under quarantine. After many patients died, he speculated their deaths were likely linked to the flu.  \\nIn a highly unusual admission of a disease outbreak apparently aimed at winning outside aid, North Korea\\'s state media said in December 2009 that nine people in Pyongyang and the northwestern border town of Sinuiju had died of the flu.  \\nSome say North Korea may not have big clusters of infections because it doesn\\'t have densely populated cities and strictly restricts freedom of movement and association. But many others disagree, saying all North Koreans are required to attend diverse state-organized group activities and a lack of adequate sanitation could worsen outbreaks. \\nChoi said many cannot afford to quarantine themselves for long because they have to work.\\n\\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \\nTwitter:   / ap_archive   \\nFacebook:   / aparchives   \\nInstagram:   / apnews  \\n\\n\\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/you...', '4']\n",
